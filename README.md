turning image to ascii works best with cartoons where there are more defined lines

## dependencies:
you need pillow which comes with python 3 as far as im aware but it gave me problems so if it does it to you try running the install command again (this is for linux):

```
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install --upgrade Pillow
```
also tkinter because pillow uses it:
```
pip3 install tk
```
